## Info (browser based overlays)
 - browser based overlay for SplitCam
 - runs locally (from your desktop/laptop
 - it doesn't use resources like images (faster rendering)
 - non-trigger
 - non-interactive
 - all editing is made manualy by changing the source markup code

## Install & Use (browser based overlays)
 * download zip file and extract its content
 * open SplitCam Software and click the + icon next to Media Layers library (tool tip : Add a new capture source layer)
 * choose Browser as source of your overlay
 * copy the full path of your html file you've downloaded
 * paste the URL in the Add Browser window / URL box and click the Add blue button
 * optional you can drag the blue corners of the layer to reposition, resize...
