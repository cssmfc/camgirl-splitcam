Using SplitCam Software to add and display a custom overlay in your live stream

## Info - SplitCam Software
 - browser based overlay for SplitCam
 - runs locally (from your desktop/laptop
 - non-trigger
 - non-interactive
 - all editing is made manualy by changing the source markup code

## Install & Use - SplitCam Software
 * download zip file and extract its content
 * open SplitCam Software and click the + icon next to Media Layers library (tool tip : Add a new capture source layer)
 * choose Browser as source of your overlay
 * copy the full path of your html file you've downloaded
 * paste the URL in the Add Browser window / URL box and click the Add blue button
 * optional you can drag the blue corners of the layer to reposition, resize...
 
I've made a short video and posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGZOeD3CvBg) if you think it helps.


## Info OBS
 - browser based overlay for OBS
 - runs locally (from your desktop/laptop
 - non-trigger
 - editable and interactive via Interact OBS feature
 - all editing can be made manualy by changing the source markup code or via Interact OBS interface
 
 
## Install & Use - OBS Software
 * download zip file and extract its content
 * open OBS and click the + icon from the **Sources** panel
 * choose Browser as source of your overlay and select the **Local file**
 * browse for the overlay html file and add it to OBS
 * right-click on overlay to open settins and select the Interact window
 * replace default side image, type/replace default text-based content
 * all editing via Interact OBS feature are in real time (if broadcast live, edits will show up in real time) 

## Troubleshooting SplitCam Software
**after adding the Browser source does't show up in streaming window of SplitCam**

*click the html file to open it in your default browser and copy the full URL path from address bar*

In Chrome browser the full URL path looks like this
`file:///C:/Users/.../.../congrats-overlay-1.html`

the important is the **file:///** prefix, make sure is there
