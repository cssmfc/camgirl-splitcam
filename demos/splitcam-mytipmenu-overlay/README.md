Using SplitCam Software to add and display a custom overlay in your live stream

## Info
 - browser based overlay for SplitCam
 - runs locally (from your desktop/laptop
 - it doesn't use resources like images (faster rendering)
 - non-trigger
 - non-interactive
 - all editing is made manualy by changing the source markup code

## Install & Use
 * download zip file and extract its content
 * open SplitCam Software and click the + icon next to Media Layers library (tool tip : Add a new capture source layer)
 * choose Browser as source of your overlay
 * copy the full path of your html file you've downloaded
 * paste the URL in the Add Browser window / URL box and click the Add blue button
 * optional you can drag the blue corners of the layer to reposition, resize...
 
I've made a short video and posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGZOeD3CvBg) if you think it helps.


## Troubleshooting
**after adding the Browser source does't show up in streaming window of SplitCam**

*click the html file to open it in your default browser and copy the full URL path from address bar*

In Chrome browser the full URL path looks like this
`file:///C:/Users/.../.../MyTipMenu-01.html`

the important is the **file:///** prefix, make sure is there
